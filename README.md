### Mobile-Expense-Tracker

The end product of the assignment is to build Expense Tracking app. 

For this assignment, implement the following features:

1. Upon launching the app, if a budget for the month has not yet been set, it should ask the user to input their monthly goal and save it.
2. Once a budget for the month has been set, the user should be shown a screen that contains a button to add their expenses for the month.
3. Upon tapping on that button, the user should be shown a modal that allows them to input details for their expenses: the name, amount, date the purchase was made on, and an icon to categorize the item. The modal should allow the user to either cancel or save the entry that they make.
4. If the expense is saved, it should then be rendered in a list on the main screen that contains the button to add further expenses.
