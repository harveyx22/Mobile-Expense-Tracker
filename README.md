### Mobile-Expense-Tracker

Upon initial opening of this application, the user is presented with a budget entry page:

Following entry of a budget, the user is directed to the main page where the current budget value is displayed:

If the user would like to add an expense to their budget, clicking the "Add Expense" button directs the user to the expense entry page where a description, amount, date, and category can be selected:

After addition of an expense, the user is directed back to the main page where the expense list will display the added expense, and the current budget will be updated:

The user can add additional expenses to continuously update their budget:

When the user adds expenses that drop the budget below zero, the main page background becomes red to notify the user that their budget has been exceeded:
